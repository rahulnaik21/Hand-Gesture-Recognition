# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
# âœ‹ Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to recognize ** hand gestures recognition**. It covers the full workflow from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `hand_machine.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the ML model on hand gesture/digit data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Model training using traditional ML or CNN (depending on the notebook)
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Predicts digits/gestures from input images

## ðŸ§  Algorithms & Tools Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (if used)
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- OpenCV (if used for hand image processing)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulnaik21/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
2.Install required libraries:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Launch the notebook:
  jupyter notebook hand_machine.ipynb
  
4.ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved high accuracy on validation/test data.
